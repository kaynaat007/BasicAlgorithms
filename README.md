# BasicAlgorithms
This is collection of Basic Algorithms. language is either java, c, or c++. 
1> BasicDFS.java 
this file is very basic DFS algorithm. this runs DFS with adjacency list represenation of graph. in the output,
it prints 4 arrays displaying parent of each node, start time of visit of each node, end time of visit of each node, 
and visited condition for each node. 
2> DFS.java 
this file finds connected component within a directed graph. take input the number of vertices and vertex asssociated with 
each node. and prints connected component within the graph . 
3> find_path.java 
checks wether a path exist between a given source and destination. this file extends DFS.java, because it uses some variables
and functions of DFS.java.
